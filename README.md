[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/laws-africa/openbylaws-wc011.svg?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.com/laws-africa/openbylaws-wc011)

This is an openbylaws.org.za microsite for [matzikama.openbylaws.org.za](https://matzikama.openbylaws.org.za).

The only thing it does is run the build process from the [openbylaws.org.za's microsite repo](https://github.com/laws-africa/openbylaws-microsite).
configured for za-wc011. The results are force-pushed to this repo's gh-pages branch, and deployed as a GitHub pages website.

See [.travis.yml](.travis.yml) for the details.

## Building locally

If you want to build the microsite locally, you're in the wrong place. Instead, you want the openbylaws.org.za microsite repo.
